*Toffoli Gate : acting as NAND Gate in the Classical Gate

1. Install Qiskit & etc
pip install qiskit qiskit-ibm-runtime qiskit_aer pylatexenc

pip install matplotlib
-> To show the Quantum Circuit

2. Confirm Quiskit Version
import qiskit
qiskit.version.get_version_info() -> current use v2.2.1

3. Basic
from qiskit import Quantum Circuit
-> use QuantumCircuit Class in the qiskit Library

circuit = QuantumCircuit(number, number)
-> generate the object of Quantum Circuit Class(n Qubit)

circuit.x(number) or circuit.x([number1, number2])
-> initialize the state of Quantum Register
The former one means that 'X gate to q(number)'
The other means that '2 X gates to q(number1) and q(number2)'

circuit.barrier()
-> express the barrier(Vertical dot-line) in the Quantum Circuit

circuit.ccx(2, 1, 0)
-> using CCX Gate(Toffoli Gate) with two Control Qubit and One Target Qubit

circuit.measure([0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2])
-> add the measure circuit with three Qubit

circuit.draw(output='mpl')
-> expose the Circuit with Image

if you use option fold=-1, then you can see a lot of circuit in the just one picture.
